# Assignment for Final Project in Getting and Cleaning Data

To understand the severall different files please have a look on the attached - "Original Experiment README.txt"

The task consisted of the following 5 parts: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable    for each activity and each subject.

All these 5 tasks are combined and executed in the script file "assignmentscript.R", which creates two different tables as a result, one which contains the whole data set as instructed and the second table containing the average measurement for each subject grouped by activity.

Within the scripts there are comments explaining each step. 

The codebook explains how the tidy data set was created and the meaning of the variables.
